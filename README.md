but seriously, it’s all yours.

## 📚 FAQ

### 1. My scrollbar looks like shit in Windows—how do I fix this?

If you’re using Microsoft Edge, head over to the `edge://flags` page and enable the `Fluent overlay scrollbars` option.
Chrome might have something similar lurking around.

### 2. Are there any plans to support Fever or Google Reader APIs?

Nope, sorry folks. For now, I’m all in on the Miniflux API—gotta pick my battles.

### 3. Why does it resemble Reeder so much?

Reeder is a fantastic RSS reader. Since my design skills are about as good as a potato's, I took some "inspiration" from
its UI style, slapped it on, and called it a day.

### 4. Any plans to add AI features like article summarization and translation?

There are so many chrome extensions that can do this. I'm not sure if I want to build this into the app. Tell me what you think by opening an issue.
